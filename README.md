# Tableau-Challenge

The goal was to pull the first 6-months citibike data from 2020. The Bike Trip.ipynb has the dataframe manipulation on the csv's brought in to make the visualizations.

A story was made for
   Dynamic map for Station Popularity
   Breakdown by Gender
   Total and average distance traveled by bike

The link below will bring you to the tableau public page. Information is within the story for each piece
